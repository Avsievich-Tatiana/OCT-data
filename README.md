# OCT-data
simple processing of A-scans to retrieve the attenuation coefficients of materials

This Python script is a graphical user interface (GUI) application used for viewing and analyzing Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images. It provides functionality to load OCT data, display the average image and its corresponding A-scan, define Regions of Interest (ROIs), calculate the linear fit within each ROI, and remove the ROIs.

Features
Load OCT data from a file
Display OCT images
Visualize the average image and its corresponding A-scan
Define Regions of Interest (ROI) on the A-scan
Calculate the linear fit within each ROI
Remove the defined ROIs
Display a table of calculated measurements
Required Libraries
